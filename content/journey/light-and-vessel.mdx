## Principle

Light represents fulfillment.  
The Vessel represents your capacity to receive it.

Growth expands the Vessel.

---

## Teaching

We often think happiness comes from external gain — success, love, recognition.

But how many times have you achieved something… and it didn’t feel as fulfilling as expected?

Kabbalah explains this through the relationship between Light and Vessel.

Light is abundance, joy, opportunity.  
The Vessel is your internal capacity to receive and sustain that Light.

If the Vessel is small, even great Light feels fleeting.  
If the Vessel is expanded, even small blessings feel meaningful.

Spiritual growth isn’t about chasing more Light.  
It’s about expanding your Vessel.

## Practice

When something good happens today:

Pause for 10 seconds.

Fully experience it.  
Appreciate it consciously.  
Let it land.

---

## Reflection

- Do I rush past good moments?
- Where do I resist receiving?
- What would it mean to expand my capacity for joy?

---

## Continue the Journey

Expand your Vessel daily.
