summary: "A tiny pause creates space for light, clarity, and choice."

## Principle
A small pause interrupts automatic patterns and makes room for awareness.

## Teaching
In daily life we often react instantly. Kabbalah teaches that awareness creates choice. The pause is where we reclaim direction.

## Practice (2 minutes)
Before replying to anything emotionally charged today, take:
1 slow breath in, 1 slow breath out, then respond.

## Reflection
- What triggers me most quickly?
- What changes when I pause for one breath?
- What response would my “higher self” choose?
