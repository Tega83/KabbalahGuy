summary: "Your words create spiritual architecture."

## Principle

Speech channels energy.  
Words shape reality.

---

## Teaching

Speech is not neutral.

In Kabbalah, words are creative forces.  
They build connection or distance.  
Clarity or confusion.  
Light or contraction.

Most speech is unconscious.

We speak to fill silence.  
We complain to release tension.  
We repeat information without reflection.

But conscious speech transforms environments.

Before speaking, ask:

Is it true?  
Is it necessary?  
Is it elevating?

Refined speech expands your Vessel.

## Practice

Choose one conversation today to approach with heightened awareness.

Slow down your words.  
Listen fully.  
Speak deliberately.

---

## Reflection

- What kind of reality do my words create?
- How often do I speak unconsciously?
- Who would I become with refined speech?
