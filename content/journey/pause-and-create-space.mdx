## Principle

Between stimulus and response, there is a moment of choice.  
That moment is where your power lives.

---

## Teaching

Most of life is lived on autopilot.

Someone says something.  
We react.  
An email arrives.  
We react.  
A memory surfaces.  
We react.

Kabbalah teaches that consciousness — not circumstance — determines our experience.  
When we react automatically, we reinforce old patterns.  
When we pause, we introduce Light.

That pause — even one breath — interrupts chaos and creates space for choice.

And choice is spiritual freedom.

## Practice (2 Minutes Today)

Before responding to anything emotionally charged:

1. Inhale slowly.
2. Exhale slowly.
3. Then respond.

Just one breath.

## Reflection

- What situations trigger my fastest reactions?
- What changes inside me when I pause?
- Who do I become when I choose instead of react?
