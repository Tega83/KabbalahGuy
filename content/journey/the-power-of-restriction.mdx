## Principle

True strength is the ability to restrain impulse.

---

## Teaching

In Kabbalah, the first cosmic act was restraint — contraction to allow creation.

Before anything could exist, there had to be space.

In daily life, we often mistake expression for strength:

Immediate replies.  
Instant purchases.  
Quick reactions.  

But restraint creates space.

And space allows wisdom to emerge.

Restraint is not suppression.  
It is conscious delay.

And in that delay, Light enters.

## Practice

Delay one impulse today by five minutes:

- A reactive text
- A complaint
- An unnecessary purchase
- A defensive comment

Just five minutes.

Notice what changes.

## Reflection

- What impulses control me most?
- What does restraint reveal?
- Where could space improve my decisions?

---

## Continue the Journey

Practice conscious restraint daily.
